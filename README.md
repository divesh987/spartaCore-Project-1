# Development

## Software
The technologies used for the creation of my game are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery. HTML was used to create the structure of the webpage used for the page of the game. It was only possible to create the structure withi this technology. To style my webpage,  CSS was required because CSS allows you to style all the HTML elements in tons of different and unique ways. The main functionality of the game was created using Javascript and Jquery. As Jquery is just a framework, it made it much easier to get HTML elements and assign them to variables. Also with the aid of Jquery it is much easier to add event listeners for any type of user input possible.

## Requirements

* Include an instruction section explaining how to play the game.
* Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
* Be styled to perfection!
* Be hosted online!

#### BONUS
* Your game could include a leaderboard.
* Your game could be 2 player.
* Your game could be played against the computer...
* You could include some fancy animations in your game...
* You could into HTML5 Audio and include some snazzy sound effects...

## How I approached the task
For the task given, I decided to first decide upon the game that I am going to develop. This process involved browsing the internet to look at other games for inspiration and ideas. Upon coming up with my idea I started to plan out how I am going to implement it. I had to design the wireframes for all the different displays that could possibly show up on the game screen. 

The tasks for the entire project were conducted using the agile methodology, in which I had 3 sprints to complete a certain amount of user stories. 

Here is my sprints layed out:

## Challenges I faced 
Throughout the duration of the project, I faced many challenges. One of the biggest challenges I faced was making the game run without submitting each player sequence. The loop complexity of this challenge caused me to sticking to using a means of submission for each sequence attempted for repitition by the player.

Another challenge I faced was scope creeping, often looking at the sprints I have felt that an extra sub feature could be implemented to make it a little better. However I had to overcome this challenge by realising that the lack of time will not allow me to add extra sub features to the given user stories. If I had not overcome this challenge, I would have definitely not reached sprint deadlines. 

An unexpected challenge I faced was merge confliction through Git. The cause of this challenge was due to the fact that I had not committed enough and lots of changes were made since the previous commit. I shall be aware in the future that I make as many commits as I can.

## What I am pleased with
There are quite a few things I am pleased with throughout this project. First being, my ability to plan the project out properly and come up with reasonable and achievable targets for each of my sprints. I am pleased with the fact that my game works the way I intended, as each player alternates play among each other and there is a clear winner of the game. 

I am pleased with the fact that my programming skills are getting better and that I am getting into the habit of creating and using functions as much as possible. It has helped me realise that functions can be re-used a lot as long as it's an input> output process. I am also pleased with the fact that this project was a constant learning process, as there were many things I had to research throughout the development of the game.

# Game
## How to run the software
The game was created on a webpage so it can be run on web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc. The game was not intended for mobile because of controls such as arrow keys. The game is best run on desktop and laptop computers. 

## Rules
* Game starts with player 1's turn.
* Player 1 will be shown a sequence of colours lighting up
* Player 2 wil be shown a sequence of arrow keys pressing
* Each player must repeat the sequence shown correctly. 
* If the player repeats the sequence incorrectly, they will lose to the other player.
